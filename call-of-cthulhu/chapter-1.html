        <h2>Chaper 1: The Horror in Clay</h2>
        <p>
            This chaper concerns a small bas-relief sculpture found among the papers, 
            which the narrator describes: 
            " [...] my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures 
            of an octopus, a dragon,  and a human caricature [...] 
            A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with 
            rudimentary wings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sculpture turns out to be the work of Henry Anthony Wilcox, a student 
            at the Rhode Island School of Design who based the work on his dreams of 
            "great Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all 
            dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror."
        </p>
        <p>
            Wilcox's dreams began on March 1, 1925, culminating in a period from 
            March 23 until April 2 when Wilcox was in a state of delirium. During the 
            same period, Angell's research reveals, there were cases of "outre mental 
            illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania" around the world â€” from 
            Paris and London, Africa and South America, Haiti and the Philippines, 
            western Ireland and India. In New York City, "hysterical Levantines" mob 
            police; in California, a Theosophist colony dons white robes to await a 
            "glorious fulfillment."
