        <h2>Chaper 3: The Madness from the Sea</h2>
        <p>
            In this chapter Thurston reads an article dated April 18, 1925, from the Sydney 
            Bulletin, an Australian newspaper. The article reported the discovery of a derelict 
            ship in the Pacific Ocean with only one survivor—Norwegian sailor named Gustaf 
            Johansen, second mate onboard the Emma, a schooner which originally sailed from 
            Auckland, New Zealand. On March 22, the Emma encountered a heavily-armed yacht, the 
            Alert, crewed by "a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes" from 
            Dunedin. After being attacked by the Alert without provocation, the crew of the Emma 
            killed everyone aboard, but lost their own ship in the battle. Commandeering their 
            opponent's vessel, the surviving crewmembers travel on and arrive at an uncharted 
            island in the vicinity of 47°9′S 126°43′W. With the exception of Johansen and a fellow 
            sailor (who then died as they made their way back to Auckland, New Zealand due to 
            madness from seeing whatever was on that uncharted island), the remaining crewmembers 
            perish on the island. Johansen never reveals the cause of their death.

            Thurston travels to New Zealand and then Australia, where at the Australian Museum he 
            views a statue retrieved from the Alert with a "cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly 
            wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal". While in Oslo, Thurston learns that Johansen died 
            suddenly during an encounter with two Lascars off the coast of Norway. Johansen's 
            widow provides Thurston with a manuscript written by her late husband, which reveals 
            the fate of everyone aboard the Emma. The uncharted island is described as "a 
            coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less 
            than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of 
            R'lyeh". The crew struggle in comprehending the non-Euclidean geometry of their 
            surroundings. When one of the sailors accidentally opens a "monstrously carven 
            portal", he releases Cthulhu:
        </p> 

        <p><i>
            "It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green 
            immensity through the black doorway.... The stars were right again, and what an 
            age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by 
            accident. After vigintillions of years, Great Cthulhu was loose again and ravening for 
            delight".
        </i></p>
        <p>
            Johansen described Cthulhu as "a mountain [who] walked or stumbled..." before fleeing 
            with his crewmembers, almost all of whom are killed. Johansen and a sailor named 
            Briden climb aboard the yacht before sailing away. However, Cthulhu dives into the 
            ocean and pursues their fleeing vessel. Fortunately, Johansen turns his yacht around 
            and rams it into the creature's head, which bursts with "a slushy nastiness as of a 
            cloven sunfish"- only to immediately begin regenerating. The Alert escapes from 
            R'lyeh, with Briden having gone insane and dying soon afterwards. After finishing the 
            manuscript, Thurston realizes he's now a possible target, thinking: "I know too much, 
            and the cult still lives".
