        <h2>Chaper 2: The Tale of Inspector Legrasse</h2>
        <p>
            This chaper discusses the first time the Professor had heard the word 
            <i>"Cthulhu"</i> and seen a similar image. At the 1908 meeting of the 
            American Archaeological Society in St. Louis, Missouri, a New Orleans police 
            official named John Raymond Legrasse asked the assembled antiquarians to identify 
            an idol carved from a mysterious greenish-black stone. Legrasse discovered the 
            relic months before in the swamps south of New Orleans, during his raid on 
            a supposed voodoo cult. The idol resembles Wilcox's sculpture, and 
            represented a "...thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural 
            malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a 
            rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters".

            On November 1, 1907, Legrasse led a party of fellow policemen in search of several 
            women and children who disappeared from a squatter community. The police found the 
            victims' "oddly marred" bodies being used in a ritual where 100 men—all of a "mentally 
            aberrant type"—were "braying, bellowing, and writhing" and repeatedly chanting the 
            phrase: "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn". After killing five of 
            the participants and arresting 47 others, Legrasse interrogated the men before 
            learning "the central idea of their loathsome faith":

            They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any 
            men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now, 
            inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in 
            dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died [...] hidden in 
            distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest 
            hulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise 
            and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were 
            ready, and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.
        </i></p>
        <p>
            The prisoners identify the confiscated idol as Cthulhu himself, and translate their 
            mysterious phrase as "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming". One 
            particularly talkative cultist, known as Old Castro, named the center of their cult 
            as Irem, the City of Pillars in Arabia, and referred to a phrase in the Necronomicon: 
            <i>
                "That is not dead which can eternal lie, 
                And with strange aeons even death may die".
            </i>

            One of the academics present at the meeting, William Channing Webb, a professor of 
            anthropology at Princeton, states that during an 1860 expedition in the western coast 
            of Greenland, he encountered "a singular tribe of degenerate Eskimos whose religion, a 
            curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and 
            repulsiveness". Webb claims the Greenland cult possessed both the same chant and a 
            similar "hideous" fetish. Thurston, the narrator, reflects that "My attitude was still 
            one of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were".
