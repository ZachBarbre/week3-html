        <h1>The Call of Cthulhu</h1>
        <p>By: H.P. Lovecraft</p>
        <p>Found among the papers of the late Francis Wayland Thurston, of Boston</p>
        <h2>Chaper 1: The Horror in Clay</h2>
        <p>
            This chaper concerns a small bas-relief sculpture found among the papers, 
            which the narrator describes: 
            " [...] my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures 
            of an octopus, a dragon,  and a human caricature [...] 
            A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with 
            rudimentary wings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sculpture turns out to be the work of Henry Anthony Wilcox, a student 
            at the Rhode Island School of Design who based the work on his dreams of 
            "great Cyclopean cities of Titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all 
            dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror."
        </p>
        <p>
            Wilcox's dreams began on March 1, 1925, culminating in a period from 
            March 23 until April 2 when Wilcox was in a state of delirium. During the 
            same period, Angell's research reveals, there were cases of "outre mental 
            illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania" around the world — from 
            Paris and London, Africa and South America, Haiti and the Philippines, 
            western Ireland and India. In New York City, "hysterical Levantines" mob 
            police; in California, a Theosophist colony dons white robes to await a 
            "glorious fulfillment."

        <h2>Chaper 2: The Tale of Inspector Legrasse</h2>
        <p>
            This chaper discusses the first time the Professor had heard the word "Cthulhu" and 
            seen a similar image. At the 1908 meeting of the American Archaeological 
            Society in St. Louis, Missouri, a New Orleans police official named John 
            Raymond Legrasse asked the assembled antiquarians to identify an idol 
            carved from a mysterious greenish-black stone. Legrasse discovered the 
            relic months before in the swamps south of New Orleans, during his raid on 
            a supposed voodoo cult. The idol resembles Wilcox's sculpture, and 
            represented a "...thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural 
            malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a 
            rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters".
        </p>
        <p>
            On November 1, 1907, Legrasse led a party of fellow policemen in search of several 
            women and children who disappeared from a squatter community. The police found the 
            victims' "oddly marred" bodies being used in a ritual where 100 men—all of a "mentally 
            aberrant type"—were "braying, bellowing, and writhing" and repeatedly chanting the 
            phrase: "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn". After killing five of the 
            participants and arresting 47 others, Legrasse interrogated the men before learning 
            "the central idea of their loathsome faith":
        </p>
        <p><i>
            They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any 
            men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now, 
            inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in 
            dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died [...] hidden in 
            distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest 
            hulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise 
            and bring the earth again beneath his sway. Some day he would call, when the stars were 
            ready, and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him.
        </i></p>
        <p>
            The prisoners identify the confiscated idol as Cthulhu himself, and translate their 
            mysterious phrase as "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming". One 
            particularly talkative cultist, known as Old Castro, named the center of their cult 
            as Irem, the City of Pillars in Arabia, and referred to a phrase in the Necronomicon: 
            <i>
                "That is not dead which can eternal lie, 
                And with strange aeons even death may die".
            </i>

        One of the academics present at the meeting, William Channing Webb, a professor of 
        anthropology at Princeton, states that during an 1860 expedition in the western coast of 
        Greenland, he encountered "a singular tribe of degenerate Eskimos whose religion, a 
        curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and 
        repulsiveness". Webb claims the Greenland cult possessed both the same chant and a similar 
        "hideous" fetish. Thurston, the narrator, reflects that "My attitude was still one of 
        absolute materialism, as I wish it still were".
        </p>
        <h2>Chaper 3: The Madness from the Sea</h2>
        <p>
            In this chapter Thurston reads an article dated April 18, 1925, from the Sydney 
            Bulletin, an Australian newspaper. The article reported the discovery of a derelict 
            ship in the Pacific Ocean with only one survivor—Norwegian sailor named Gustaf 
            Johansen, second mate onboard the Emma, a schooner which originally sailed from 
            Auckland, New Zealand. On March 22, the Emma encountered a heavily-armed yacht, the 
            Alert, crewed by "a queer and evil-looking crew of Kanakas and half-castes" from 
            Dunedin. After being attacked by the Alert without provocation, the crew of the Emma 
            killed everyone aboard, but lost their own ship in the battle. Commandeering their 
            opponent's vessel, the surviving crewmembers travel on and arrive at an uncharted 
            island in the vicinity of 47°9′S 126°43′W. With the exception of Johansen and a fellow 
            sailor (who then died as they made their way back to Auckland, New Zealand due to 
            madness from seeing whatever was on that uncharted island), the remaining crewmembers 
            perish on the island. Johansen never reveals the cause of their death.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thurston travels to New Zealand and then Australia, where at the Australian Museum he 
            views a statue retrieved from the Alert with a "cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly 
            wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal". While in Oslo, Thurston learns that Johansen died 
            suddenly during an encounter with two Lascars off the coast of Norway. Johansen's 
            widow provides Thurston with a manuscript written by her late husband, which reveals 
            the fate of everyone aboard the Emma. The uncharted island is described as "a 
            coastline of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less 
            than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror—the nightmare corpse-city of 
            R'lyeh". The crew struggle in comprehending the non-Euclidean geometry of their 
            surroundings. When one of the sailors accidentally opens a "monstrously carven 
            portal", he releases Cthulhu:
        </p> 

        <p><i>
            "It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green 
            immensity through the black doorway.... The stars were right again, and what an 
            age-old cult had failed to do by design, a band of innocent sailors had done by 
            accident. After vigintillions of years, Great Cthulhu was loose again and ravening for 
            delight".
        </i></p>
        <p>
            Johansen described Cthulhu as "a mountain [who] walked or stumbled..." before fleeing 
            with his crewmembers, almost all of whom are killed. Johansen and a sailor named 
            Briden climb aboard the yacht before sailing away. However, Cthulhu dives into the 
            ocean and pursues their fleeing vessel. Fortunately, Johansen turns his yacht around 
            and rams it into the creature's head, which bursts with "a slushy nastiness as of a 
            cloven sunfish"- only to immediately begin regenerating. The Alert escapes from 
            R'lyeh, with Briden having gone insane and dying soon afterwards. After finishing the 
            manuscript, Thurston realizes he's now a possible target, thinking: "I know too much, 
            and the cult still lives".
